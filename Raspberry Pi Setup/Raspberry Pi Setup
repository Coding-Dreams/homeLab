UNTIL STEP 8 MAKE SURE YOUR PI IS **NOT**!!!!! CONNECTED TO THE EXTERNAL ITNERNET. NO PORTFORWARDING!!!!
->Very vulnerable until step 8

1. Get arch linux
2. login as alarm (default passwords alarm)
        -> ssh alarm@[IP]
        -> alarm
3. su as root
4 change pwds
5. get nftables
        ->disable iptables (systemctl disable iptables)
        -> get nftable (sudo -S nftable)
6. nano etc/nftables.conf
    -> change ruleset to following:
             flush ruleset

            table inet filter {
              chain input {
                    type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;
                    #allow localhost ports
                    iif "lo" accept

                    #allow alarmpi
                    tcp dport 22 accept
              }
              chain forward {
                type filter hook forward priority filter;
              }
              chain output{
                    type filter hook output priority filter;
              }

            }
    ->This will drop all traffic except localhost and port 22 (alarmpi)
    -> Will add nginx sutff soon
7. systemctl enable nftables
        -> make sure ruleset is correct after reboot with: nft list ruleset
8. Setup NGINX (diff doc)
